# Qognet Threat Genome

The Qognet Threat Genome is a living, self-evolving repository of exploit patterns and attack vectors. It ensures that the entire Qognet ecosystem learns from every attempted attack.

## Features

- **Shared Intelligence:** When a threat is detected on one chain, the signature is propagated to all protected networks.
- **Continuous Learning:** The database updates automatically as new attack methods are discovered.
- **Immutable Record:** Threat signatures are cryptographically verified and stored.

## Evolution

As the Qognet Mesh detects new threats, the Genome expands, making the AI smarter and more resilient over time.
