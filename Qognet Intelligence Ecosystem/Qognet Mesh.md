# Qognet Mesh

The <code>qognet</code> Mesh is the decentralized infrastructure responsible for the ingestion of real-time blockchain data, execution of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, and achieving consensus on the generated security intelligence.

It represents the resilient interconnectivity layer, bridging the gap between raw infrastructure and hyper-intelligent defense.

## How It Works

Unlike traditional centralized clusters, the Mesh functions as a self-healing, peer-to-peer lattice nodes. By leveraging a gossip-based protocol, the Mesh ensures that threat signatures identified by a single node propagate across the global network in milliseconds.

This lateral data sharing creates a "herd immunity" effect: once an anomaly is detected in one region, the entire ecosystem’s firewall parameters update instantly. The Qognet Mesh is the physical manifestation of collective security.
