# Overview

Web3 has transitioned from an experimental sandbox into a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure, yet it still relies on outdated, reactive security methods that fail against dynamic threats. While traditional audits only offer static snapshots of code health, they cannot stop sophisticated economic exploits that occur in real-time.

Qognet creates a paradigm shift from forensics-based recovery to Defensive Intelligence (DI). By utilizing a proactive AI framework and decentralized networking, Qognet predicts and neutralizes threats before malicious transactions are even confirmed, allowing the security ecosystem to evolve faster than its adversaries.

## Introduction to Qognet?

Qognet is a full-stack, decentralized security ecosystem designed to provide the foundational layer of trust and safety. It is a fusion of AI, cryptoeconomics, and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), built around a single mandate: prediction over reaction.

## Products

The Qognet ecosystem is composed of highly integrated, modular products:

- **Qognet AI:** The engine that analyzes transaction flows and on-chain behaviors to generate the Qognet Safety Score (QSS).

- **Qognet Mesh (DePIN):** The distributed network of specialized nodes (Sentinel, Cognito, Validator) responsible for high-speed data collection and threat signal propagation.

- **Qognet Threat Genome:** The self-learning, shared repository of exploit patterns and behavioral signatures, ensuring the AI continuously learns from every attack attempt globally.

- **Qognet BioFirewall:** The final enforcement layer, integrated via API/SDK into wallets and DApps to automatically block transactions with low QSS scores.

- **Qognet ZK-IDN:** The Zero-Knowledge Identity Network that ensures privacy-preserving trust and anonymous contribution across the platform.

## Core Mission: Creating a Defensive Layer of Cognition Across Blockchains

Our mission is to infuse decentralized networks with a layer of Cognition, the ability to sense, analyze, predict, and act autonomously against threats.

Qognet aims to be the invisible, always-on security neural network intelligence protecting assets across all major blockchain. By creating a unified, self-healing, and proactive defensive spine, we reduce systemic risk and unlock the next wave of capital inflow into the decentralized economy.
