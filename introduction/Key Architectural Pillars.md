# The Three Pillars of Qognet

To successfully pivot the security paradigm from reaction to prediction, Qognet is built upon three architectural pillars:

1. **Predictive Cognition (The Brain)**   
   Most security looks for bugs; we look for bad behavior. The Qognet AI analyzes real-time data to spot malicious intent before a transaction is even confirmed. It produces a Qognet Safety Score (QSS), which is a live risk rating that tells our firewall exactly when to step in and block a threat.

2. **Decentralized Speed (The Mesh)**   
   Security is a race against the clock. Our DePIN Mesh is a global network of specialized nodes that communicate at sub-second speeds. Using resilient protocols, we ensure that threat signals reach every corner of the network instantly. We make sure the defense moves as fast as the attack.

3. **Future-Proof Security (Quantum-Ready)**   
   We aren’t just building for today; we’re building for the next twenty years. Qognet integrates Quantum-Resistant Cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Identity to ensure that our network and your data stays secure even as computers get more powerful. We provide a foundation that won’t collapse as technology evolves.

By combining these three, Qognet is built to be the mandatory backbone for the future of decentralized finance.
